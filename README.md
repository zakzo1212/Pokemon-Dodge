# Pokemon-Dodge
 A Pokemon-based video game made with inspirsation from the classic iPhone game, Flappy Bird.
 
 The player controls a Pidgey as it navigates through and dodges a barrage of enemy Pokemon coming at it. Along the way, Pidgey can collect 'TMs', which allow Pidgey to fire an attack straight forward, eliminating any enemy Pokemon it hits on contact. Once the player has survived for a certain amount of time, a boss Mewtwo appears, which will fire attacks at Pidgey on top of the continuing barrage of enemy Pokemon. The player must continue to dodge all enemies and attacks until they land three attacks on Mewtwo, eliminating it. Following this, the player wins the game!
